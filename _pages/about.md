Hi! I am a PhD Student at <a href="https://www.nig.ac.jp/nig/" target="_blank" style="color:#3B528B;">National Institute of Genetics</a> working on how the gut microbiome can influence animal domestication using mice as a model. <br> 

Over the years, I have acquired a diverse set of skills in both wet lab and dry lab techniques. My wet lab expertise includes molecular biology, microbiology, mouse behavior analysis, and mouse phenotyping. In the dry lab, I have developed strong proficiency in metagenome analysis, genome assembly, phylogenomics, and the computational analysis of behavioral data, enabling me to uncover complex biological insights from large-scale datasets. Additionally, I have experience in generating metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and creating specialized databases to support the scientific community.

Feel free to contact me for any inquiries or potential collaborations in any research topic. You can reach me at <a href="mailto:bhimbiswa@nig.ac.jp" target="_blank" style="color:#3B528B;">bhimbiswa[at]nig.ac.jp</a>.<br>
