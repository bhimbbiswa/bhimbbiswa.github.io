I am a postdoctoral researcher currently working at [INRAE – UMR RECOVER](https://www6.paca.inrae.fr/recover/) based in Aix-en-Provence (France).

I am particularly interested by research questions which lies at the interface between ecology and conservation biology. The overarching aim of my research is to investigate the effects and the impacts of global change drivers on biodiversity patterns (at species and community scale) to guide conservation strategies by combining statistical models and empirical data.

For more information about my research experience, see my [curriculum vitæ](cv).

Feel free to contact me for any request, potential collaboration…
