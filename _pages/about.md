I am a PhD Student at <a href="https://www.nig.ac.jp/nig/" target="_blank" style="color:#3B528B;">National Institute of Genetics</a> working on how the gut microbiome can influence animal domestication using mice as a model. <br> 

# <b>My current research focuses on finding out the influence of gut microbiome on tameness behaviour using selective bred mice as model.</b>
# I investigate these questions by combining open-access databases on environmental, trait, trophic interaction, and phylogenetic characteristics, data from the field or from experiments, and statistical modelings to #integrate and synthesize data. Most of this work focuses on islands or island-like ecosystems (e.g. lakes). <br>
