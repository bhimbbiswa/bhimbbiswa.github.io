Hi! Iâ€™m a postdoctoral research associate at the <a href="https://pedicordlab.com" target="_blank" style="color:#3B528B;">Pedicord Lab</a>, University of Cambridge, UK. My research focuses on the gut-brain axis and its potential impacts on health and disease. I completed my PhD in 2024 from the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mgrl-koide-lab/home" target="_blank" style="color:#3B528B;">Koide Lab</a>, National Institute of Genetics, Japan, where I investigated how the gut microbiome can influence animal domestication using mice as a model.

Throughout my research journey, I have honed a diverse skill set in both wet lab and dry lab techniques, with a particular emphasis on metagenomic analysis. In the wet lab, I specialize in molecular biology and microbiology, with extensive experience in various **mouse behaviour analyses** and phenotyping. My dry lab expertise includes advanced **metagenome analysis, genome assembly, phylogenomics, and analysis of behavioural data**, enabling me to extract and interpret complex biological insights from large-scale datasets. Additionally, I have successfully generated **bacterial** and **viral** metagenome-assembled genomes (**MAGs**) and developed specialized datasets to support the broader scientific community.

Feel free to contact me for any inquiries or potential collaborations. You can reach me at <a href="mailto:bbb27@cam.ac.uk" target="_blank" style="color:#3B528B;">bbb27[at]cam.ac.uk</a> <br>
