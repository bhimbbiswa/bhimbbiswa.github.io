I am a post-doctoral researcher at <a href="https://www6.paca.inrae.fr/recover/" target="_blank" style="color:#3B528B;">INRAE – UMR RECOVER</a> working on the structure of ecological networks and environmental gradients in lakes.
My research addresses fundamental questions at the interface of community ecology, macroecology, and conservation biology. I investigate how global change affects patterns of biodiversity and how this can be used for conservation.
I investigate these questions by combining open-access databases of environmental, trait, and phylogenetic characteristics, observational data from the field, and statistical modeling to integrate and synthesize data, particularly on climate and animals. Most of this work focuses on islands or island-like ecosystems.

*Key words:*<br>
biogeography; community ecology ; conservation biology ; global changes ; macroecology ; multiple facets of biodiversity ; vulnerability assessment
