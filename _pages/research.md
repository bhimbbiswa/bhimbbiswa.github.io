As the rate and magnitude of the current biodiversity crisis accelerate, a greater understanding of the threatening processes impacting biodiversity is required to guide effective conservation strategies. To tackle this challenge, I explore, across large spatial scales, biodiversity patterns in the current and future context of global changes by addressing the questions of how threats co-occurred and interacted with diversity, or the potential consequences of threatening processes on the multiple dimensions of biodiversity.

As anthropogenic environmental changes increasingly threaten biodiversity and ecosystem functioning worldwide, assessing the vulnerability of species to threats, and in particular to climate change, is a prerequisite for developing effective strategies for keeping them. To address this challenge, I apply biodiversity vulnerability approaches based on a combination of components including exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity.

Understanding whether and how environmental conditions may impact food-webs structure is central to our ability to predict how food-webs will respond to global change. To address this challenge, I explore the influence of natural and anthropic environmental variables (and particularly temperature) on the structure of food-webs by addressing several research questions of how environmental factors shape food-webs structure/stability and community size structure.
