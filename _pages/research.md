What are the current and future threatening processes impacting biodiversity? What are their impacts? To apprehend these cornerstone questions in ecology and conservation biology, I mostly focused on island ecosystems that host unique fauna and flora particularly vulnerable to global changes. I am interested to explore biodiversity patterns in the current and future context of global changes by addressing several research questions. Here are some examples:

* How threats co-occurred and interacted with diversity?  
* What are the potential consequences of threatening processes on the multiple dimensions of biodiversity (taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic)?

Based on the different outputs from patterns of biodiversity and/or threatening processes, I am also interested to highlight conservation value of particular areas for improving systematic conservation planning.

## <span style="color:#440154">**Assessment of natural and anthropic environmental drivers on community food-webs**</span>
**Collaborators:** <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Victor-Frossard" target="_blank" style="color:#3B528B;">Victor Frossard</a>, <a href="https://arnaudsentis.com/" target="_blank" style="color:#3B528B;">Arnaud Sentis</a>

Understanding whether and how environmental conditions may impact food-webs structure is central to our ability to predict how food-webs will respond to global change. To apprehend these cornerstone questions, I focused my research on freshwater ecosystems and more particularly on lakes. I am interested to explore the influence of natural and anthropic environmental variables on the structure of food-webs by addressing several research questions. Here are some examples:

* How spatial patterns in food-webs structure are associated with environmental gradients?  
* How species, e.g. sensitive to global change, contribute to food-webs structure?

Based on the different outputs from patterns of food-webs structure, I am also interested to develop a functional indicator of the impact of global change, and particularly climatic, on communities and their resilience.
