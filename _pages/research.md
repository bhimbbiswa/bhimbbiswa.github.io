# **BIODIVERSITY & GLOBAL CHANGE DRIVERS**

## <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><span style="color:#440154">**Global change and biodiversity – patterns and impacts**</span></span>

As the rate and magnitude of the current biodiversity crisis accelerate, a greater understanding of the threatening processes impacting biodiversity is required to guide effective conservation strategies. To tackle this challenge, I explore, across large spatial scales, biodiversity patterns in the current and future context of global changes by addressing the questions of how threats co-occurred and interacted with diversity, or the potential consequences of threatening processes on the multiple dimensions of biodiversity.

## <span style="color:#440154">**Environmental conditions and community structure – patterns and impacts**</span>
Understanding whether and how environmental conditions may impact food-webs structure is central to our ability to predict how food-webs will respond to global change. To apprehend these cornerstone questions, I focused my research on freshwater ecosystems and more particularly on lakes. I am interested to explore the influence of natural and anthropic environmental variables on the structure of food-webs by addressing several research questions. Here are some examples:

* How spatial patterns in food-webs structure are associated with environmental gradients?  
* How species, e.g. sensitive to global change, contribute to food-webs structure?

Based on the different outputs from patterns of food-webs structure, I am also interested to develop a functional indicator of the impact of global change, and particularly climatic, on communities and their resilience.
